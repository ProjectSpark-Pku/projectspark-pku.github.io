          <p className="AU-body">
            In a city full of bright, curious, ambitious young people, thousands are growing up in adoption centers with limited access to quality education, mentorship, or a reason to dream big. The gap between where they are and where they could be isn't about ability — it's about access. Project SPARK exists to close that gap. Not with a one-time donation. Not with a single event. But with a long-term, sustainable commitment to education, empowerment, and transformation.

            <p className="AU-body">
              Project SPARK began with a visit. A small group of friends from Pekanbaru stepped into a local adoption center — not with a plan, but with curiosity. What they found stayed with them. The conditions were difficult. Resources were scarce. But the children? The children were something else entirely. Bright eyes. Quick laughs. An eagerness to learn that no circumstance had managed to dim.
            </p>
            <p className="AU-body">
              It was that contradiction — so much potential in such limited surroundings — that made walking away impossible. Within weeks, the group had a name, a mission, and their first program on the calendar. Project SPARK was born not out of obligation, but out of the belief that these children deserved better, and that a group of young people could actually do something about it.

          <p className="AU-body">
            A lot of charitable work is built around moments — a day of giving, a one-time event, a donation that gets forgotten by the following month. We respect that. But it's not what drives us. Project SPARK was designed from the start around sustainability. We return to the same centers, build relationships with the same children, and design programs that compound over time. Chemistry experiments that spark a love of science. English lessons that open up a world of opportunity. Computer skills that make a child employable years before they'd otherwise have had the chance.
          </p>
          <p className="AU-body">
            Our vision of success isn't a great event recap. It's a child from a Pekanbaru adoption center walking into a university ten years from now — and knowing that a spark helped get them there.
