                  Pintar 2 expanded Project SPARK's reach to a new orphanage in Pekanbaru. With a redesigned program built around chemistry, art, physics, and math, we pushed further into what hands-on learning could look like — and the children pushed right back with curiosity and energy we didn't expect.

          <h2>Building on What We Started</h2>
          <p>Pintar 2 wasn't just a repeat — it was an evolution. Taking our experience from the first program, we redesigned the curriculum around subjects that were even more visual and tactile, making abstract concepts impossible to ignore.</p>
          <p>Reaching a new orphanage meant introducing ourselves all over again, building trust with a new group of children, and adapting on the fly. It reminded us that every center is different, and that flexibility is just as important as preparation.</p>

            <h3>Learning That Sticks</h3>
            <p>When a child watches oil change color in their hands, or holds up a bridge they built themselves, something clicks that no textbook can replicate. Pintar 2 was designed around that moment — the moment curiosity turns into understanding. By expanding to a new center, we didn't just reach more children. We learned more about what it takes to truly connect with them, and that made every program after this one stronger.</p>
