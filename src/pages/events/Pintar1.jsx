          <p>Pintar 1 is conducted through on-site visits to orphanages, where student volunteers facilitate small-group learning sessions.</p>
          <p>Instead of traditional classroom teaching, sessions are designed around simple projects and activities that encourage children to explore ideas through doing, not memorizing.</p>

            <h3>Learning Through Experience</h3>
            <p>Learning at Pintar 1 goes beyond listening and memorizing. Through hands-on activities and collaborative projects, children are encouraged to explore ideas, ask questions, and learn by doing. This approach helps build confidence, curiosity, and a genuine excitement for learning, especially for children who may not always have access to supportive educational environments.</p>
