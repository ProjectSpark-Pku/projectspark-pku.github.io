                  Stella Bazaar was held at Stella Gracia school — a one-day food bazaar where Project SPARK members sold homemade cookies, takoyaki, and matcha drinks to raise funds for the children we were preparing to help. It was nerve-wracking, exciting, and exactly the kind of first step that makes everything else possible.

          <p>Before we could give, we had to build. Stella Bazaar was Project SPARK's answer to that challenge — a grassroots fundraiser run entirely by student volunteers at Stella Gracia school.</p>
          <p>Setting up the stall, managing the crowd, handling sales — none of us had done it before. But by the end of the day, we had raised a meaningful sum and, more importantly, proven to ourselves that we could make things happen.</p>

            <h3>Why It Mattered</h3>
            <p>Stella Bazaar wasn't just a fundraiser — it was the moment Project SPARK became real. The funds we raised went directly toward supporting the children we would later visit through our Pintar and Shine programs. Every cookie sold, every cup of matcha poured, was a small act that added up to something much larger. It gave our team the confidence to dream bigger and the resources to start delivering on that dream.</p>
